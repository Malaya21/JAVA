Sure, here are some short notes on the difference between object-oriented programming (OOP) and procedural programming:

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Concept**: Based on objects and classes.
- **Key Principles**: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction.
- **Structure**: Programs are organized around objects, which combine data and behavior.
- **Reusability**: Promotes code reuse through inheritance and polymorphism.
- **Examples**: Java, C++, Python, Ruby.

### Procedural Programming
- **Concept**: Based on procedures or routines (functions).
- **Key Principles**: Sequence, Selection, Iteration.
- **Structure**: Programs are organized around procedures or functions.
- **Reusability**: Code reuse is achieved through functions and procedures.
- **Examples**: C, Pascal, Fortran, Basic.

### Key Differences
- **Focus**: OOP focuses on objects and data, while procedural programming focuses on functions and logic.
- **Modularity**: OOP provides better modularity through objects and classes, whereas procedural programming uses functions.
- **Data Handling**: OOP encapsulates data within objects, while procedural programming uses global data accessible by functions.
- **Maintenance**: OOP is generally easier to maintain and extend due to its modular nature.


### Classes and Objects in Java

#### Classes
- **Definition**: A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a datatype by bundling data and methods that work on the data into one single unit.
- **Components**: A class typically includes fields (variables) and methods (functions) to define the properties and behaviors of the objects.
- **Syntax**:
    ```java
    public class ClassName {
            // fields
            int field1;
            String field2;

            // methods
            void method1() {
                    // method body
            }
    }
    ```

#### Objects
- **Definition**: An object is an instance of a class. It is created from a class and represents a real-world entity with state and behavior.
- **Creation**: Objects are created using the `new` keyword followed by the class constructor.
- **Syntax**:
    ```java
    ClassName objectName = new ClassName();
    ```
- **Example**:
    ```java
    public class Car {
            // fields
            String color;
            String model;

            // constructor
            public Car(String color, String model) {
                    this.color = color;
                    this.model = model;
            }

            // method
            void displayInfo() {
                    System.out.println("Car model: " + model + ", Color: " + color);
            }
    }

    public class Main {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                    // creating an object
                    Car myCar = new Car("Red", "Toyota");
                    // calling a method on the object
                    myCar.displayInfo();
            }
    }
    ```
    ### Concept of OOP

    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure software programs. It is based on several key concepts:

    - **Objects**: Instances of classes that represent real-world entities with state and behavior.
    - **Classes**: Blueprints for creating objects, defining their properties (fields) and behaviors (methods).
    - **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (class), restricting direct access to some of the object's components.
    - **Inheritance**: Mechanism by which one class can inherit properties and behaviors from another class, promoting code reuse.
    - **Polymorphism**: Ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface, allowing methods to be used interchangeably.
    - **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.

    These concepts help in creating modular, reusable, and maintainable code, making OOP a widely used programming paradigm in software development.
    ### Attributes and Methods in Java

    #### Attributes
    - **Definition**: Attributes, also known as fields or properties, are variables that hold the state of an object.
    - **Usage**: They are defined within a class and represent the characteristics of an object.
    - **Example**:
        ```java
        public class Car {
            // attributes
            String color;
            String model;
        }
        ```

    #### Methods
    - **Definition**: Methods are functions defined within a class that describe the behaviors of an object.
    - **Usage**: They operate on the attributes of the class and can perform actions or return values.
    - **Example**:
        ```java
        public class Car {
            // attributes
            String color;
            String model;

            // method
            void displayInfo() {
                System.out.println("Car model: " + model + ", Color: " + color);
            }
        }
        ```
