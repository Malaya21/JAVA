Let us discus JAva interview questions
____________________________________________________

Q 1. What is Java?
Java is a high-level programming language originally developed by Sun Microsystems and released in 1995. Java runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX. 

Q 2. What are the supported platforms by Java Programming Language?
Java runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX/Linux like HP-Unix, Sun Solaris, Redhat Linux, Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.

Q 3. List any five features of Java?
Some features include:
1. Object-Oriented
2. Platform-Independent
3. Simple
4. Secure
5. Architecture-Neutral

Q 4. Why is Java Architectural Neutral?
Java is architecture-neutral because the Java compiler generates class files that contain bytecodes. These bytecodes can be executed on any machine that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This allows Java programs to be run on any platform without needing to be recompiled, it simply called "write once, run anywhere." .

Q 5. What is a JVM?
JVM is Java Virtual Machine which is a run-time environment for the compiled Java class files. JVM is the component responsible for executing the Java bytecodes.

Q 6. What is the difference between a JDK and a JVM?
JDK is Java Development Kit which is for development purposes and it includes execution environment also. But JVM is purely a run-time environment and hence you will not be able to compile your source files using a JVM.

Q 7. What is the difference between the JRE and JVM?
JRE is Java Runtime Environment which is the implementation of JVM. JRE provides the libraries, Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components to run applets and applications written in the Java programming language.

Q 8. What is a pointer and does Java support pointers?
A pointer is a reference handel to a memeory location in C ans c++ programming. Java does not support pointers because they are unsafe (can be used to access memory locations directly) and complex to understand.

Q 9. What is the main difference between Java platform and other platforms?
The Java platform differs from most other platforms because it's a software-based platform that runs on top of other hardware-based platforms. It has two components: the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the Java Application Programming Interface (API).

Q 10. What gives Java its 'write once and run anywhere' nature?
The bytecode. Java is compiled to be a byte code which is the intermediate language between source code and machine code. This byte code is not platform specific and hence can be fed to any platform.

Q 11. What is a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler?
